## Summary

**Raylib.c3** is what I would say a stable release. It will continue to mature and expand as Raylib releases further versions.

Hope is to make this binding utilise many great aspects and features of C3 to make writing code with Raylib even more easier and enjoyable without sacrificing performance. 

## Roadmap

The current roadmap is:

- [ ] Add raygui binding.

## Covered API

- [x] raylib.h
- [x] raymath.h
- [x] easings.h *- C3's internal standard library easing can be also used with Raylib.c3!*
- [ ] raygui.h

## Known Issues

None as of yet.
